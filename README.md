The Institute Portal is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to centralize all academic and learning-related activities for students. Through this portal, students can register and securely log in to access
institute-specific services. The portal provides up-to-date information about online class schedules, important announcements, and notices, ensuring students stay informed at all times.

The integrated quiz enables students to attempt quizzes and assessments directly within the institute portal, eliminating the need for external platforms. These quizzes help in evaluating student understanding,
improving engagement, and supporting continuous assessment.

In addition, students can view recorded lecture sessions directly on the same platform, allowing them to revisit classes for better understanding and revision.

The portal also offers access to study materials such as notes, assignments, and reference documents, along with personalized features like student profiles, where learners can manage their personal and academic
details. By bringing multiple academic resources under one system, the portal enhances convenience, accessibility, and learning efficiency.
